This would result in gas cars with tiny engines and very slow acceleration making those zippy electric cars more attractive.  So what is the problem with high gas prices?  Well now the problem is with the Dems getting reelected.  High gas prices are something a lot of the voters see.  Voting for that clueless confused geriatric hiding in his basement has resulted in these consequences.

So now Biden's puppeteers want to suck down the strategic petroleum reserve in a hope to drop gas prices maybe 20 cents/gallon and we should be happy with this after it went up about $2.  Then after November hoping the voters get duped they will restock the reserves with way more expensive petroleum and the gas prices will shoot way up, but no problem, election is over.

Do you think a capitalist will invest more or less in a particular industry, if they are constantly required to deal with union organizers? The answer - less. This brings slower economic growth, less wealth for everyone, and lower wages for everyone, including union workers in the long run. It is a way to universally distribute poverty and inefficiency. Look at our auto industry, it moved out of America, largely due to unions. In economics, there is always an alternative - the auto industry is a perfect example. You cannot regulate and legislate your way to wealth in an economy. It takes innovation, and capital investment. Unions are by design headwinds to these wealth creating engines. 

I also just can't understand, given the record of corruption, graft, and political shenanigans how unions are still taken seriously. Based on their continual decline in membership, most of the Country has learned to be wary of Unions.

In February NATO had a much larger military capabilities than Russia.  Russia has used its best troops and weapons losing in Ukraine.  What is left is older, less capable and les reliable than what they have been using for the past 6 weeks and longer. &nbsp;

Also it appears that though Russia has developed modern military capabilities, its been for show.  They put on a nice parade, but do not appear to have built much for war.

People have been providing substandard weapons and supplies to the military while buying  condominiums in London and yachts everywhere.  There may be a great deal less of all of these weapons and supplies than the Russian military has been told.

Finally, the US and Western Europe can get more and better weapons and supplies to the front lines because of superior logistics and they can easily out produce Russia in manufacturing weapons and supplies.

However, if the driver is going the correct speed and has their eyes on the road there is little chance of hitting someone. Outside of the urban area I don't see this much. What I do see are people speeding and not paying attention to the road. I've noticed a large increase in the sounds of racing. Whether in the morning or later afternoon I can tell when commuting time comes because I hear the roar of aftermarket exhaust and motorcycles as they race up the highway. It is worse when the expressway has backups on it because of construction.

The reason is simple. People do what they feel they can get away with. I see people of all ages ignoring stop signs and stop lights. Especially if they are turning right and think they can turn ahead of the person coming; often without even stopping at the light or sign. One person almost was hit because they had the light to cross and the driver was more concerned about seeing if they could pull in front of oncoming traffic than about pedestrians.

It's simple selfishness which is going up because society is reinforcing itself that everyone is a victim and should care more about themselves than others.

9,9,2022-04-07 11:54:12.082025,"I think the author hinted at the middle ground.  Time and Technology - without the need for further government subsidies - should bring the winning combination to the market.  I sincerely doubt that over-the-road trucking will widely adopt electric power - the recharge time is too long to delay the pace of transportation of goods.  And existing technology will not substitute  for hydrocarbon fuels for aircraft and military vehicles.  Hydrogen power would require a huge domestic investment in new delivery infrastructure, but would be simplest for conversion of existing internal combustion engines.  The next step beyond that would be the hydrogen fuel cell to power electric vehicles.  That allows quick refueling rather than hours plugged in for recharging batteries.  At that point, over the road truckers may find it advantageous to make the switch.

There is truth in this, one reason for Nixon's trip was to separate China from the Soviet Union. But that would be only half of the truth. The other half is that even then Nixon, Kissinger and the business circles around them were already sensing the vast business opportunities a West-friendly China would offer, compared to tiny Taiwan. So they cheerfully betrayed Taiwan - another case of the infamous perennial Western perfidy, just like the West betrayed the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. The one little thing they missed was that you never make pacts with the devil (i.e. Communism) and hope it want drag you to Hell. Yes, it will. We know the result: a gigantic economic and technological juggernaut that is an existential threat to the West (far more than Russia is). All created by Western capital and Western technology. Sure, many in the West became billionaires from the China business (Tim Crook, uhm, ""Cook"" comes to mind). But the West and the whole world is in existential danger as a result.

Only the Ukrainian government and its people can make that decision.  

At some point in what is becoming a protracted war in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the opinions and narratives of other western media (not paying the price of that war) need to be secondary to those of the Ukrainian people who are actually dealing with this.

At BEST, he/she, if she's well ""above average"", may have mitigated the pain a bit with a prudent, fairly-priced and reasonably-allocated mix of investments that mitigate the losers enough to compensate for their AUM fee relative to the overall market decline.

In January 1973, I gave a talk to the First Annual Pensions Conference on how to allocate the current year pension contribution among the fund's investment managers.
When I stated that you should allocate the money to the worst performing managers for the trailing 3-5 years - with the caveat ""No Turkeys!"", there was a cacophony of incredulity.

You might say that they knew what they were getting in to and they should be responsible. Well, they are being misled by the Universities they attend. Representatives travel around the country telling potential students how much money they will make with a certain degree and that paying off their student loans will be easy.  Also consider that tuition when you are applying to school will raise every year without warning or justification. When a friend was in school tuition raised $13,000 from one year to the next. That's not peanuts and by that point you are committed. You can't walk away from the program with the debt you already have and hope to find a job that pays well enough to justify leaving. Your only way out is through.

3) Implement the pitch clock currently in use in the minor leagues;
4) Commercial breaks between innings limited to 90 seconds (the networks will ignore this but at least the games will keep moving);
5) Shrink the strike zone - waist high to mid-chest is a good start. If pitchers want to throw split finger fast balls that's fine but the ball is going to have to be in the strike zone when it gets to the plate.

It makes the game slow due to the pitching changes and boring due to the home run or strikeout problem. Shrinking the pitching roster size would be a good start. For my money, I'd like to see the default be for a pitcher to pitch 9 innings. Over time, we'd see a different breed of pitchers emerge that have more endurance than the glass cannons of today (it will take time, these guys will need to be trained differently and throw differently).

If a pitching changes cost a run, managers would think twice.",,,04-07-2022,mlb-baseball-manfred-rules-shift,https://www.wsj.com/articles/mlb-baseball-manfred-rules-shift-11649299976?mod=hp_listc_pos2,https://www.wsj.com/?mod=nav_top_section,105,590,0,6,0,,0.051,0.073,0.877,-0.3182

What about this: a team can make unlimited pitching changes, but every pitcher that comes in past the third pitcher is ineligible to play in the next game (or you could make it two games--someone better at statistics can figure out which makes most sense).  In extra innings, you get one extra change per every three innings, but your last pitcher at the end of of the ninth inning has to play at least three innings total.  

This would make teams manage pitching much differently because if you want to go to a closer game after game, you cannot do the carousel of relievers or when you go to your closer, you will lose him for the next game (or two).

I think this would also have the effect of shrinking pitcher rosters because you will need to concentrate pitchers over more innings than currently.  In theory, it could have the opposite effect--larger pitching rosters so that managers burn through pitchers and have substitutes when they lose them for a game or two--but that would dilute the quality of pitching so much that I don't think it would be viable.

 (over a 25% rate of increase in 2 years,
far higher than the long term real growth rate of the American economy)
appears to have been an excellent predictor of the surge of inflation in 2021 and 2022. 
This was not forecast by the army of Fed forecasters. 
M2 growth was not indicating that the rise would be transitory, as the Fed maintained. It is a bit of mystery as to why the Fed officials and Chair Powell does not ever mention M2 growth in public.
M2 proved to be a far better predictor than whatever Chair Powell was using.
Historic evidence of the correlation between M2 growth and inflation suggests now the ratio between M2 and GDP is still quite high, and the rate of inflation will not necessarily be short lived and easily brought down to 2%/year.
Watch for a dramatic slowing of M2 growth for preliminary evidence of a future slowing in the rate of inflation.
Another indication would be a fed funds rate exceeding the actual rate of inflation.
At the moment the PPI wholesale inflation is 10% year/year, and the rate of the fed funds in only one half of one per cent.  Quite a negative real rate of interest by this measure. In the last bout with this kind of inflation

China is now both the most indebted country in history as well as the oldest by average age.  This year they began what will be the greatest demographic collapse in history.  This is why Xi, who knows this all too well, has been centralizing his power to try and protect the CCP.  He saw very clearly the superiority of western arms against the best Russia had to offer, and most of China's technology such as it is came from Russia so he is not feeling very confident against a modern military armed with the best of the west and with more flooding in every day.

No nuclear weapons in Ukraine (should be OK). 3. Stop the suppression of minorities (mainyl Russians in Ukraine) - should be OK. 4. Stop blackmailing Russia with the gas-pipeline across Ukraine (should be OK). As the US want Europe to buy liquified gas from the US, Biden and Obama did their best to make this gas-transit as difficult to Russia as possible. Biden did his best to hamper Russian gas expoert to Europe. Sadly, many in Europe (mainly, Germany) took the bait. 5. Implicitly, Russia wants a government there which is not a US puppet (as well-known, the US helped the coup in 2014 against a legitimate Ukrainian president). This can be achieved if Ukraine is not governed by its existing oligarchs and warlards. If people vote for whoever, I assume that should be OK with Russia if Ukraine is non-Nato and remains free from nuclear weapons. 6.

to the Crimean peninsula where Russia has had a Naval base for a very long time, (Their only naval access to the strategic warm oceans on the south of Russia)could have avoided this tragic and as of yet unresolved situation that has unknown major worldwide risks.

Talks between the US and Ukraine started to convince the Ukrainian's to give up their nuke.
