Putin fifteen years ago said that NATO expansion is an intolerable threat to Russian security. Given that the US staged a coup d’etat in Ukraine in 2014, put missiles on the Russian border in Poland and Romania (admitted to NATO in 1999 and 2004 respectively), and has turned Ukraine into a de facto NATO base by pouring in weapons and training militias, I would say that he has a valid point.

59,59,2022-04-03 17:42:38.237784,"Hard to believe, but this actually has been happening all over USA due to low mortgage rates. Landlords can make more money borrowing against artificially inflated property values, even if they are vacant, since commercial appraisals of vacant property is based on the average rental pricing of nearby non-vacant property.

There are a number of excellent password managers and some of them are free for basic services....I recommend LastPass and 1Password. 

More than 90% of successful hacks are a result of phishing attempts sent via email. Never click on a link from an untrusted source which may directly infect your device or take you to a malicious website. Also, never enter sensitive information (e.g. SSN, driver's license, DOB, etc.) unless visiting a trusted site at your initiation (i.e. logging into the IRS to pay your tax bill) and make sure you verify the site's SSL certificate which you can do by hovering over it with your mouse.

I know cybersecurity sounds daunting, but most hackers are not particularly sophisticated. They take advantage of people being lazy who reuse easy to guess passwords, don't keep their operating systems up to date, etc.

Reading some of these comments, I had to laugh: commenters insisting that life insurance is a bad investment. 
It's not a bad investment or a good one. It's not an investment.
It's insurance. 
Believe it or not I have to explain that to CPA's and tax lawyers. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew demolished my home in Miami. Andrew did about $140,000 worth of damage. I had moved in two years previously and paid about $3,000 total in homeowner's insurance premiums. Allstate paid me $140,000. (I'm simplifying.) What was my profit?
""Ah,"" I get told, ""your profit was $140,000 less the $3,000 you paid for the coverage. Net profit: $137,000.""
Yes, CPA's tell me that. They overlook the $140,000 loss. In fact I had no profit but a loss of $3,000, the cost of two years' coverage.
You buy insurance to compensate yourself or a beneficiary for a financial loss. 
If you buy insurance with the idea of making a profit, either you're planning a crime or you don't understand what insurance is, including life insurance.
It's not an investment. You buy it to get compensated (or to compensate your beneficiary) for a loss that will take years to make up, or that can never be made up.
BTW there are essentially two reasons why people buy life insurance: 1) they love someone; 2) out of a sense of financial responsibility, for example to fund a buysell agreement in a business.
I might add that term insurance has its uses but so does permanent.

Let's start with the first premise, that does not go unchallenged about the need for life insurance.  A young person, married or not, with no actual dependents (people who truly depend on them for their financial well being) does not in any way need life insurance.  Their death, while sad, will no financially impact anyone else, so why purchase a policy, it is a waste of money.
Since we don't have details on the actual policy, we can't even judge if it was a good one or not, but I myself purchased a $250K 10 year term policy and it was $22/ mo.  I was 46 at the time of purchase.  After it expired, I did not purchase another one even though I have 7 kids ad a wife because all of the kids were out of HS and some college and my wife is able bodied and can work just fine if she needs to, never mind the fact that we have a pretty solid net worth that eliminates the need for a policy.

Claims that somehow the ongoing reinterpretation of antitrust, even a pretty thorough-going re-interpretation of antitrust, even from an ""originalist position,"" is not the norm is a pretty bizarre assertion.

I'm gay but honest about all of it, including (and especially, given my arithmetic-heavy personal background), and can shed some light on some of what you wrote. See, it's a big deal with me: ""Thou shalt not mess around with the numbers.""

Kinsey wrote that one in eight males (12-1/2%) consider themselves primarily homosexual for at least three years of their lives, usually when they are young. 4% are lifelong homosexual. He wrote that these proportions are half for women, yielding the 3% you cited. Do the numbers for that 3-year group, and it comes out to  9-3/8%. 

In the 1970s, the activists rounded it up to 10%, i.e. 1 in 10. I have no problem with the rounding itself given that the underling numbers themselves can only be seen as educated guesses. The problem is that 10% is too high. Kinsey wrote that two-thirds of the ""three-year"" group wind up being heterosexual in adulthood. 

Kinsey's methods and scholarship have been attacked, with some justification, but that 3% number has stood the test of time. To the extent that any surveys are accurate, there's a lot of support for it. Maybe it's a bit higher than 3%, but I don't think by much. 

And yeah, I think a lot of people overestimate the proportion. To be fair, I have never seen or heard anyone in the media go higher than 10%. Maybe it's happened and I'm not aware of it.

Maybe not a majority and maybe not commited, but I'd imagine many agree that Russia is threatened and there is some religious support for Putin too.  Putin's popularity might be greatly exaggerated, but it exists at some significant level. Stalin is still reasonably popular as a hero of ""The Great Patriotic War"", as is Mao in China, and both killed millions of their countrymen. 
The threat of Ukraine or even NATO somehow overrunning Russia is nonsense, of course, and politically manipulative, like Hitler's claims of German mistreatment in the Sudetenland.  But most Chinese would see the Uighur situation differently than we (or the Uighurs) do. The muted reaction from co-religionists to the plight of the Uighurs from Islamic theocracies is, well, disturbing.    Even India, with access to a Western press, is not particularly appalled at Russia's behavior. Nor is much of the Mideast.  And there are Cubans or Venezuelans who support their government, possibly out of habit or insecurity, but also from a belief in socialism or communism undeterred by its horrible results. 
I think the idea that everyone has basically adopted a Western viewpoint is a dangerous perspective.

The way religion was bound to government in Europe was the main reason for our 1st amendment against such a thing in the US. Our earliest settlers were fleeing from government persecution for practicing their own religion. Many of the wars in Europe were centered around religion for centuries, both within and separate from the Roman Catholic Church and the various religion's attachment to the government. 

The 1st amendment stricture against state sponsored religion has, of course, been taken too far, to the extent a school connected to a church had to sue for a share of government funds to put a kid-friendly surface on their playground.

They panicked because most investors on TD Ameritrade and Robinhood have no idea how the Fed actually works.

You don't need ""high yielding corporate paper"" to make a nice profit, because anything is profit. It's like putting your money in an interest-free savings account - anything the bank makes from your money is profit to them.

The two companies mentioned are the ones that are making the risky bets to short. I guess they are hoping that the US will ban stablecoins, which would result in a run of people trying to cash out.

Remember who China's customers are, North America and the EU.  Russia is just a resource. Aggressive action by China will merely accelerate the movement of supply chains out of China and further alienate export customers and their foreign financial investments in China. 
I am not worried about China engaging in Europe.  China, like India, thinks in terms of strategic indifference. They are in no hurry to provide material help, but are eager to take advantage of a weakened Russian economy.  
Arguably WWIII is already underway and we need to think about strategic actions now.

In 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia; in 1941 Hitler invaded the USSR (causing 20 million deaths) and in 1961, the US installed nuclear armed Jupiter missiles in Turkey (NATO member, bordering USSR). The latter action prompted Khrushchev to install similar missiles in Cuba during 1962. A nuclear armageddon was averted when both the US and the USSR agreed to remove their threatening missiles.

Given this history, it is not unreasonable to think that the Russian people distrust the West and fear future aggression from that direction. That's their reasoning behind the ""no NATO"" for Ukraine requirement.

The diplomacy of Reagan and Bush from 1985-1992 was instrumental in ending the cold war and positioning a new era for Russia.&nbsp;The opportunity was lost, however, when President Clinton launched an attack on Serbia (a Russian ally) in 1999, and endorsed the addition of Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary to NATO. It was only then that Putin replaced Yeltsin as Russia's leader.

Putting NATO on Russian borders is like having Chinese military bases and missiles in Mexico and Chinese fleets patrolling the Gulf of Mexico.

George Kennan in a famous 1997 NYT op-ed ""A Fateful Error"" argued strongly that ""expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.

But, the collapse (from 1985-1992) of Communism changed everything. Russia once again became a Christian nation, archives were opened, friendships were established.

At this point, the phasing out of NATO may have been considered. SEATO was dissolved in 1977 when its mission ended. Of course, Europeans wanted to cling to NATO because the US, effectively, paid their defense budget. This allowed Europeans to dispense ""free stuff"" (university education and health care) and boast about how enlightened they were.

Indeed, Putin (and most Russians, I suspect) want a USSR-sized country once again in order to be a ""main player"" on the world stage, as well as providing a ""buffer zone"" against the West.

You should reread my post detailing how Trump bolstered the defenses of Eastern Europe and how he had no reservations about killing Russians in Syria.

He also closed Russian consulates in Seattle and San Francisco, expelled dozens of ""diplomats"" and imposed numerous sanctions on Russia and Russians.

Trump hurt Russia economically by expanding US oil exploration, thus driving down the price.

Trump's policies towards Russia stand in stark contrast to those of the Obama era: i.e. creating a ""great power"" vacuum in the middle east, thus allowing Russia to establish long-sought bases (greatly expanded naval base in Tartus and new air base in Khmeimim, both in Syria), and launching a war of choice against Libya, to Russia's benefit (Gazprom's new oil leases).

Trump had decades of negotiating experience and showed a willingness to ""make a deal"". Biden was incapable of negotiating, which is why we are in the current situation.

At our base, our targets were in Russia, near Moscow where we would drop two nukes. Of course, the time and distance to cover from the US to Russia was many miles and hours, so it was doubtful that there would be targets remaining after the missiles struck. Nevertheless, we would have fulfilled our obligation to our country on what was a one-way mission. 

The US has been on nuclear alert and prepared for a war that will end life on earth as we know it (as have the Russians and Chinese) for at least 60 years. I suppose we can and will sustain these incredible weapons that continue to get more deadly and more accurate. With the new hypersonic weapons, there is really no defense other than capituation.

What has been accomplished in 60 years? First, there has been no nuclear war, so the MAD theory has worked so far. There has yet to be a leader who is insane enough to ignore reality. Second, we have been engaged with the Soviets/Russians/Chinese  in proxy wars all over the world at the cost to all sides of millions of lives lost and trillions of dollars spent.

Kasparov is willing to risk WW III for a country that is neither part of NATO nor should it be. American national security is not served with drawing the line in the sand in Ukraine, a country with a massive border with Russia. Quite the opposite: with Ukraine in the NATO every small incident would trigger a high alert and potentially create a crisis the way we see it on the demarcation line between North and South Korea. Regime change in Russia is the responsibility of the Russian people not the American foreign policy establishment. Their recent record with regime change experiments has been disastrous for the people of Iraq, Syria, Libya and tens of thousands of American men and women in uniform.

Backing off now would hand Putin a victory when he faces impending defeat. That would be utter madness. In time, Putin would regain the initiative and renew the fight at his own convenience. 

Ukrainian battlefield success  and sustained economic sanctions should, over time, sap Russia's will and ability to continue its aggression. The objective should be to leave Putin with an unambiguous loss: Russia out of <em>all</em> of Ukraine, not just back to the pre-war lines-of-control;  Europe less reliant on Russian oil and gas; and NATO better prepared and more unified in their core mission, defending NATO nations from Russian aggression.  

Biden seems focused on a quick, Potemkin ""victory"" as a prop for the November elections.  He should instead be seizing this opportunity to advance a critical strategic objective: irretreivably blunting the Russian threat to eastern Europe's independence.   That would leave Europe more secure and better prepared to defend itself, give Xi and China a lesson in the perils of aggression, give small nations around the world courage to defy aggression and preserve their independence, and leave the U.

""If we believe in uniting the right... now is the time for open-hearted and full-throated support of Ukraine and its leader.""
""Now is not the time to continue fighting the struggles that seemed to matter before Feb. 24.""
""Just as many of the America First isolationists... came around to the overwhelming need for the U.S. to join in the struggle against Japan and Germany...so Mr. Zelensky’s critics on the right should heed the courage of a people who are battling a more massive and naked display of barbarism by a great power than most people alive can remember.""

It has also promoted the growth of the middle class in countries that were once divided between the rich and poor.  The world is becoming more equatable as nations become more interdependent on trade with each other. This reality stands  in stark contrast to the presumption that the mere existence of the superrich is somehow impoverishing  the world.  The defining measure of an economic system’s benefit is the equality of opportunity that it provides to all its people to obtain affordable food, housing, healthcare, and a good education for their children. The American middle class is an excellent example of this and should be the standard to measure the benefits that any economic system provides for its citizens.",Raul Campos,3.0,04-03-2022,xi-jinpings-common-prosperity-was-everywhere-but-china-backed-off,https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-jinpings-common-prosperity-was-everywhere-but-china-backed-off-11648978380?mod=hp_lead_pos5,https://www.wsj.com/?mod=nav_top_section,136,838,0,1,0,,0.188,0.04,0.772,0.9705

If you hit something in the middle of nowhere and tell the officer it was a deer, they are going to assume it was a deer. There are about 1,000,000 deer hit by cars in the U.S. every single year. It's beyond common place. There are not 1,000,000 investigations nor do the cops look in the weeds for the deer or give a sobriety test. Most don't even get reported to law enforcement. It seems most commenters do not appreciate how truly common and dangerous deer are in most of the country.

What happened AFTER he realized he hit a man and not a deer, I don't know. His story is truly plausible that he didn't know. He surely acted like it. Everything else seems supposition. All accused should be treated like your spouse or child or someone you care dearly for. If this was their story, would you expect them to go to jail or even get fired? No, you would believe them because it is plausible.

We need more details than this article provides. a guy in dark clothes walking in the road (is there a wide walkable berm?) even with a small flashlight can easily blend into the darkness.

So it is reported that nobody questions who won the  Hungarian election.  The question is, was the election itself conducted fairly?  This has a familiar ring to it.

Imagine, if you will, that California and New York sent hundreds of ""observers"" to Florida to monitor the Florida elections?  What would be said if these people claimed the elections to be unfair?  What if the EU as a whole were to send such observers to France?

Of course, the latter would never happen, but when one member state deviates from the comfortable orthodoxy of the majority, there is a tendency to meddle.

They try to stay pragmatic, neutral, and balance geopolitical realities. 90% of their gas is from Russia. They took in a lot of refugees and provided other support to Ukraine (not weapons)

Like McDonalds, Starbucks is constantly falling into the trap of an expanding menu and trying to be too many things to too many people, which cuts down the the speed of filling orders and diminishes the quality of each order.
